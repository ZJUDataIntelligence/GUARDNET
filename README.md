## GUARDNET

This is the dgl implementation of GUARDNET 

the processed dataset can be downloaded at  [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Xd6WAaD2bM1TLmBuOMz-pQ?pwd=bb77 ). 

It is worth noting that, as delineated in the paper, the outcomes generated by our code when executed on disparate machines may exhibit minor variations attributable to distinct machine parameters and related factors.

## Requirements

* pytorch

* pytorch-geometric

* scikit-learn

* python 3

* jupyter notebook
  
* dgl


## Usage

To run the code 

1.  Need to download the processed dataset firstly at  [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Xd6WAaD2bM1TLmBuOMz-pQ?pwd=bb77 ).
2.  cd to *code* : Execute `python graph_construction.py -k_rw=10 -k_khop=2 -k_ego=3 -gamma=0.2 ` to individually generate graph datasets for train.
3.  cd to *code* : ` python train.py -lr=0.01 -device='cuda' -epochs=100 -graph='graph/ccfraud_graph.bin'` .
